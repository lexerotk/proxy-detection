# Proxy Detection

The back-end project to control malicious connections (VPN/Proxy/Tor) for my website.

Coded to work with plain HTML, CSS and JS combo. And this makes it possible to work with [Github Pages](https://github.io).

Uses two different APIs to work. IPifyAPI at front-end side (check [my own github page](https://github.com/lexerotk/lexerotk.github.io/blob/main/script/securitycheck.js) for example) and ProxyCheck.io API for detecting the use of proxy. ProxyCheck.io needs an API key.
