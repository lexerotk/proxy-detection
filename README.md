# Proxy Detection

Simple proxy detection API to take control over VPN, proxy and Tor requests.

Coded to work with plain HTML, CSS and JS combo.

Using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as back-end server.

Uses two different APIs to work. IPifyAPI at front-end side (check [my own github page](https://github.com/lexerotk/lexerotk.github.io/blob/main/script/securitycheck.js) for example) and ProxyCheck.io API for detecting the use of proxy. ProxyCheck.io needs an API key.

> [!NOTE]
> The projects itself doesn't store any IP adresses. This is not an IP logger or doxxing tool.
